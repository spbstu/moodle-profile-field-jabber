Jabber Profile Field for Moodle:

This profile field allows users to introduce their jabber account and, if one
Jabber Presence Server has been specified, shows the user status (connected,
away, do not disturb ...). Servers like OpenFire provide this service.

Suitable for Moodle Servers that run one corporate Jabber server for all their
accounts.

To install, just copy the "jabber" folder inside your Moodle user/profile/field
directory. Then, in the admin block, go to Users->Accounts->User profile fields
and add one "Jabber + presence" field. Define the URL of the presence server,
leaving the JABBERID keyword to be replaced automaticaly by each user jabber id.

That's all. Enjoy and ciao :-)
